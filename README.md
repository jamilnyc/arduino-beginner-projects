This repo is intended to be a collection of simple Arduino circuits I come up with to help me learn how to use the board. Nothing special.

### How To Use
* Load the `.ino` files into the Arduino IDE
* Verify/Compile the files
* Set up the circuit
* Upload the program

### To Do List For Each Circuit
- [ ] Add circuit block diagram
- [ ] Add photo
- [ ] Add code
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section
